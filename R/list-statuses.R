#' GET lists/statuses
#'
#' @param list_id required The numerical id of the list.
#' @param slug required You can identify a list by its slug instead of
#'   its numerical id. If you decide to do so, note that you'll also have
#'   to specify the list owner using the owner_id or owner_screen_name
#'   parameters.
#' @param owner_user optional The screen name or user ID of the user
#'   who owns the list being requested by a slug.
#' @param since_id optional Returns results with an ID greater than
#'   (that is, more recent than) the specified ID. There are limits to the
#'   number of Tweets which can be accessed through the API. If the limit
#'   of Tweets has occured since the since_id, the since_id will be forced
#'   to the oldest ID available.
#' @param max_id optional Returns results with an ID less than (that is,
#'   older than) or equal to the specified ID.
#' @param count optional Specifies the number of results to retrieve per "page."
#' @param include_rts optional When set to either true, t or 1,
#'   the list timeline will contain native retweets (if they exist) in
#'   addition to the standard stream of tweets. The output format of
#'   retweeted tweets is identical to the representation you see in
#'   home_timeline.
#' @param token OAuth token. By default \code{token = NULL} fetches a
#'   non-exhausted token from an environment variable. Find
#'   instructions on how to create tokens and setup an environment
#'   variable in the tokens vignette (in r, send \code{?tokens} to
#'   console).
